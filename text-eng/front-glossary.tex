\emph{Correlation coefficient} measures the degree of linear dependence between two univariate random variables.\\
\emph{Canonical Correlation Analysis} is a way of measuring the linear relationship between two multidimensional variables.\\
\emph{Principal Component Analysis} is a dimensionality reduction technique based on maximization of variance.\\
\emph{Singular Value Decomposition} is a factorization of a real of complex matrix.\\
\emph{Vector Space Model} is a representation of textual data in a vector space, based on counting the occurrences of words, which correspond
to vector space dimensions.\\

\emph{$k$-means Clustering} is grouping algorithm that groups objects into groups according to their similarity.\\
\emph{Symmetric positive semidefinite matrix} is symmetric matrix with nonnegative eigenvalues.\\
\emph{Semidefinite programming} is a subfield of convex optimization concerned with the optimization of a linear objective function over the intersection of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices with an affine space.\\
\emph{Dual Representation} expresses vectors as linear combinations over the training set.\\
\emph{Hilbert space} is a vector space equipped with an inner product.\\
